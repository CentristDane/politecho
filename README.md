## PolitEcho 

As students of a small liberal arts college in New Jersey, we were completely convinced that Hillary Clinton would be our next president. So when Donald Trump crossed the 270 Electoral College points threshold, we asked ourselves, how were we so wrong? Our Facebook news feeds promised a Clinton landslide that failed to materialize. Thus we realized that our small liberal arts college in New Jersey friends do not represent America. According to John Oliver of *Last Week Tonight with John Oliver*, we’re “just sounding off on the internet or sharing think pieces or videos like this one, that echo around your bubble.” So naturally we ask ourselves, do we actually live in a bubble on Facebook? And how strong is the echo? Thus emerged PolitEcho. 



# The Political Science Behind PolitEcho 


One of our team members is currently taking American Politics, of which an entire week was devoted to studying the concept of public opinion. In *The Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion*, political scientist John Zaller presents his famous RAS(Receive-Accept-Sample) model of public opinion. It was based on Four Axioms. 


A1: Reception Axiom:
The greater a person’s level of cognitive engagement with an issue, the more likely she or he is to be exposed to and comprehend (i.e. “receive”) political messages concerning that issue.
 
A2: Resistance Axiom:
People tend to resist arguments that are inconsistent with their political predispositions, but they do so only to the extent that they possess the contextual information necessary to perceive a relationship between the message and their predispositions.
 
A3: Accessibility Axiom:
The more recently a consideration has been called to mind or thought about, the less time it takes to retrieve that consideration or related considerations from memory and bring them to the top of the head for use.
 
A4: Response Axiom:
Individuals answer survey questions by averaging across the considerations that are immediately salient or accessible to them.


Thus, the probability that the individual will give a liberal response is:  
Probability(liberal response) = Liberal messages available / (Liberal messages available + Conservative messages available) 


Zaller also assumes that the messages are from elite discourse rather than from personal interactions. This key distinction made our project possible but we can assume that an individual’s public opinion is based on elite discourse, such as the media and politicians rather than their friends. Thus, we did not have to try to hack Facebook for process a user’s personal political discourse over Messenger. Rather, we can assign an individual a liberal/conservative score based on their interaction with elite discourse: public pages they’ve liked on Facebook. 


We divided up elite discourse into three sections: reputable news sources, fake news sources, and politicians. Though Zaller’s model says nothing about elite discourse that provides misleading information, we feel it is an important source to include due to the controversial role fake news is claimed to have played in the most recent presidential election. We gathered a database of the Facebook pages of reputable news sources, fake news sources, and politicians and assigned them weights then used that to assign a score to each user, lower scores being more liberal and higher scores being more conservative. 


Zaller’s RAS model is meant to be applied on an individual basis but PoltiEcho is able to classify hundreds of people at once, allowing us better under how the media and social media affect public opinion and potentially even the outcome of an election. When used within a friend group, our visual graph will literally show you the bubble you live in on Facebook.
